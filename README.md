# Tyre Puzzle

At a caf√© in Toowoomba, some friends and I were intrigued by a
simple-looking puzzle made to entertain children. It was made of a
couple dozen tyres laid out, with coloured planks attaching adjacent
ones. The rules were simple: follow the planks in order of Red, Blue, Green, starting from the single tyre next to the rules board, and get to the raised tyre in the centre.

This repo contains a Python solution to the puzzle, using NetworX and a
few tricks.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo
- Install the python dependencies with
  [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org), then enter a shell:
  ```
  $ poetry install
  $ poetry shell
  ```
- Use `solve.py` to find solutions, using puzzle files from `./puzzles`. E.g.:
  ```
  (tyre-puzzle) $ ./solve ./puzzle/puzzle_original.txt --start=A --goal=J
  ```
- Run tests with PyTest:
  ```
  (tyre-puzzle) $ pytest .
